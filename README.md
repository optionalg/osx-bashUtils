# bashUtils
(for OS X)

A few bash commands targetting mainly the OS X environment.  
They can potentially work within other OS supporting the bash shell.


## Quick start

1. Retrieve the files either by downloading the latest .zip file from
   [github.com/christophercrouzet/osx-bashUtils](https://github.com/christophercrouzet/osx-bashUtils)
   or by cloning the git repository using
   `git clone https://github.com/christophercrouzet/osx-bashUtils.git`.
2. Place the files located within the `bin` directory into your `/usr/local/bin` directory,
   or equivalent, and the files from the `man` directory into `/usr/local/share/man/man1`.


## Features

### chmodrestore

* restores the default chmod values for files and/or folders.

### cleanup

* deletes predefined kinds of files and/or folders.


## Documentation

In a shell, type `<name_of_the_command> -h` to print a quick overview of the available options or
`man <name_of_the_command>` to display a more detailed help.


## Versioning

Versions numbers will comply with the [Sementic Versioning (SemVer) specification](http://semver.org/)
and will be written in the form `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, where:

* backwards incompatible API changes increments the major version (and resets the minor and patch versions).
* backwards compatible API additions/changes increments the minor version (and resets the patch version).
* bug fixes not affecting the API increments the patch version.
